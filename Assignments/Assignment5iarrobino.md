# Deepfakes and Software: A Comparison

## Watching the Moon Disaster Deepfake

The deepfake film In Event of Moon Disaster shows what would have happened if the Apollo 11 mission failed. It features a fake speech by President Nixon, created using advanced voice and video editing tools. When watching it, the speech felt surprisingly real. The tone, style, and even the video quality matched what you’d expect from the 1960s. It was hard to tell that it wasn’t real at first. This experience shows how easy it is to trust something that “looks right,” even if it’s fake.

## 1. What Makes a Deepfake Believable?

There are many things that can make a deepfake more believeable, the fact that this video seemed like it was recorded in the past with an old, grainy camera can make it more believable to younger generations that never experienced that era of technology. Visually it was much more convincing than a lot of the deepfakes that are meant to mimic today's technology because of the grainy, vintage visuals. The voices also sounded convincing, aside from Nixon's, I would not have been able to tell it was AI generated audio. The message, voices, and visuals of this video matched many of the real videos i've seen on History channel or youtube for example, and when you combine all of these together you naturally trust what you're seeing. One thing I did notice though, that really tipped it off was the smoothness of visual transitions, it was way too smooth and didn't match what was capable with cameras at the time. I do believe if you showed this to someone who had no idea of the events that occurred, they would believe that it's real, which is a scary thought. I also believe this is why AI generated content (videos, audio, music, art, etc) should be looked down upon and shunned, it has no place in society and exists only to rewrite history and mimic human artistic capabilities. AI should be reserved for completing emperical tasks that humans don't want to do.
