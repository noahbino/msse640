# Assignment 4


### Discuss

- What are some of the AI Assisted Coding tools, e.g. Cursor? Will they replace coding as a skill?
- If learning to code will become less important, what new skills will software engineers need to have.
- Many think that software engineers will need to develop people skills more than ever. Will AI out perform people in that area as well?

### Response

AI Assisted coding tools like cursor are becoming more powerful development tools as AI progresses. They can do many things, including:
- Autocomplete complex code blocks 
- Suggest certain algorithms
- Generate unit tests
- Refactor messy code
- Help debug
- Among many other uses

These tools are already boosting productivity for beginners and experienced developers, but I believe they are best for experienced developers. I think new developers should go through the learning process of actually understanding the foundation of whatever language or platform they are coding on before they start generating large blocks of code. If this is not the case, begineer developers can easily waste time by not understanding foundational concepts and even introduce more bugs to a program. 

In the long term, I do think coding will become obsolete, you will tell an AI bot what you want to build and it will build it, but you will slowly have to beat it into shape by providing feedback and requests along the way - pretty similar to how we develop currently. I believe we are still very far from this, and in the near term we will only use AI to increase developer productivity. Things like unit testing, filtering complex lists, complex queries can easily be done with AI that is available today, and the longer experienced developers take to adopt them, the further they fall behind. We should embrace AI with a fair amount of skepticism, but also a fair amount of optimism, it can make our lives much easier so long as we do not forget our foundational education.
